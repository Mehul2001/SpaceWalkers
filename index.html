           <p>As we got further and further away, 
               it[the Earth] diminshed in size. 
               Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, 
               the most beautiful you can imagine.The beautiful,
                warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,
                 that if you touched it with a finger 
                 it would fall apart.
                  Seeing this has to change a man.

          <p>
              Never in all their history have meb beem able to 
              truely to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere,a globe, having the 
              qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
              eventually meet.
               Which there is no center because every point, or none, is 
               center - an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
               The airman's earth, if free men make it.

             <p>
                 The Earth was small, light blue, and so 
                 touchingly alone, our home that must be 
                 defended like a holy relic. The Earth 
                 was absolutely round.
             </p>
             <p>
                     Suddenly struck me that tiny pea, pretty and blue,was the Earth. I put 
                  up my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
